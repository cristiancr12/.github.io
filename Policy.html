            18 AND OVER POLICY:  New york state law prohibits anyone under the age of 18 from getting a tattoo.  
            And no, we cannot accept parent or guardian consent.  
            You must be at least 18 years old and you must provide valid government issued photo ID in order to get tattooed.
        </p>

        <p class="p2">
            MINIMUM CHARGE POLICY:  Our shop minimum covers the time and expense of a sanitary set up and clean up 
            of the equipment and procedure area as well as single use supplies necessary to provide a clean and safe tattoo 
            applied by an experienced professional.  Our minimum is the absolute lowest amount we will charge for any tattoo.  
            This applies per person getting tattooed, per session.  If you are getting a tattoo of one tiny dot, the cost will be the minimum.  
            If you and a friend are getting matching tiny dot tattoos, the cost for each of you will be the minimum each.  If you want multiple 
            tiny tattoos on your body at the same tattoo session, you will be charged a flat rate or hourly (so if you want multiple tiny tattoos, 
            it is more cost effective for you to get more than one at a time).  Please note that any tattoo that takes more than 30 minutes will automatically 
            cost more than the minimum.
        </p>
                
        <p class="p3">
            CANCELLATION POLICY:  All appointments require a minimum of 48 hours notice for cancellation.  If cancelled with over 
            48 hours notice, your deposit may be applied to a future appointment.  DEPOSITS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.
        </p>
                
        <p class="p4">
            RESCHEDULE POLICY:  All appointments require at least 48 hours notice to reschedule.  If at least 48 hours notice is given, 
            your deposit may be applied to your new appointment.  If an appointment is rescheduled more than twice, your deposit will be forfeited.
        </p>
                
        <p class="p5">
            LATE POLICY:  Please let us know if you are running late for an appointment.  If you are 30 minutes or more late for an appointment without 
            advance notice, you may forfeit your deposit, lose your appointment and be required to reschedule and leave a new deposit.
        </p>

        <p class="p6">
            DEPOSIT POLICY:  DEPOSITS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. Deposits will be applied towards the final cost of your tattoo at your final session 
            unless your deposit is forfeited. Deposits are forfeited if you no-show for an appointment, cancel with less than 48 hours advance notice, 
            reschedule more than twice, arrive for an appointment more than 30 minutes late, arrive for an appointment without proper ID or arrive intoxicated 
            or otherwise unable to be tattooed, request excessive or last minute changes to the design or concept, do not complete your tattoo within 
            two years, or decide not to get tattooed at all. If you forfeit a deposit, you may be required to leave a new deposit before booking any 
            new appointment(s). Deposits may not be transferred to another person or for use with a different tattooer.
        </p>

        <p class="p7">
            ARTWORK POLICY:  We will not email, text, or preview a custom design for your review until your scheduled appointment. 
            Any revisions that stay within the idea discussed at the consultation can be made on the day of your appointment.  
            If you change your idea, placement, concept, etc and major or excessive revisions are required, your deposit will be 
            forfeited and your appointment will need to be rescheduled and a new deposit may be required.
        </p>  
            
        <p class="p8">
            CUSTOM TATTOO POLICY:  Out of respect for the original artist and collector, we will not copy or duplicate any 
            custom tattoo or tattoo design.  This applies to tattoos we have created custom for our clients as well as tattoos 
            found online or elsewhere that someone else has created.  If you fall in love with a tattoo that an artist has done, 
            please ask the artist to create something similar or inspired by that tattoo for you.  Remember we can (and prefer to) 
            customize it specifically to you and for your body.  PLEASE NOTE: Flash tattoos are meant to be duplicated and can be 
            tattooed many times, with or without customization.
        </p>    
            
        <p class="p9">
            TOUCH UP POLICY: Courtesy touch ups are at the discretion of the tattoo artist. 
            Necessary touch ups related to the technical application and healing of a tattoo 
            are free if done within 6 months of the tattoo and by the original artist who did 
            the tattoo (unless the tattoo is on a non-guaranteed body part, see below). 
            Touch ups cannot be done until the tattoo is fully healed.  Touch ups due to client 
            failure or negligence to follow our aftercare procedures are not free and will be charged 
            the same rate as a new tattoo.  Changes to the original agreed upon tattoo are not considered 
            a touch up and will be charged as a new tattoo.  HEALING RESULTS OF TATTOOS ON THE HEAD, FACE, 
            GENITALS, FEET, OR HANDS (INCLUDING FINGERS) CANNOT BE GUARANTEED AND MAY NOT BE ELIGLE FOR FREE 
            TOUCH UPS.  If your tattoo is on a non-guaranteed body part it will probably need multiple touch 
            ups and may be charged as a new tattoo each time.
        </p>
                
        REFUND POLICY: NO REFUNDS for any reason. In the unlikely event of a mistake it is the duty of the 
        artist to fix it for free. There is always something we can do.  Please contact the studio as soon 
        as possible to allow us to find the best & quickest solution.<br><hr>
                
        QUEST POLICY: You may bring only one guest with you to accompany you while you get tattooed. 
        Your guest must be over the age of 18.  Out of respect for the other clients getting tattooed 
        who need to relax as well as the artists who need to focus on their tattooing work, any excess 
        guests or disruptive guests will be asked to leave.  Children or minors are not permitted in the 
        tattooing area at any time.  Be aware that tattoo shops are intended for a adults only and even 
        an accompanied minor in the lobby area may see some nudity or hear adult language.<br><hr>
                
        PETS POLICY: The health department prohibits any animal or pet in the tattooing area.  
        Service animals are permitted in the lobby area and must not be left unattended at any time.<br><hr>
